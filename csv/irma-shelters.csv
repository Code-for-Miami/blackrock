Monroe County is opening four refuges of last resort due to the challenges of evacuating all Keys residents and the life-threatening winds and dangerous storm surge expected from Hurricane Irma.

The following refuges of last resort will open at 7 a.m. on Saturday. No services will be available at those sites. And, they only will be open until tropical storm force winds subside.

These refuges of last resort are only to provide a safe location to ride out the storm rather than to be stuck in a vehicle or structure that is unsafe.  They will close again after the unsafe weather conditions have passed.  They are not recovery shelters.

MONROE COUNTY special needs-only shelter

When threatened by a Category 3 (and above) Tropical Cyclone, Florida State Law requires the evacuation of all Monroe County residents to the mainland. Florida International University is the designated out-of-county shelter for Monroe County Special Needs Clients (SNC) only. Monroe County Special Needs population evacuates out of the county for ALL category storms and would be directed to the FIU campus.

When it is anticipated that Tropical Storm Force (TSF) winds are forecasted to affect the Florida Keys within 72 hours, the Monroe County Shelter Manager will initiate coordinating calls between the agencies. These calls will continue until the order for the evacuation is implemented – typically at the 36-42 hour period prior to the arrival of TSF Winds. Notification will be made to the designated agency officials no less than 4 hours prior to the anticipated issuance of an out-of-county evacuation order. Note that even though Miami-Dade County may NOT be under alert in these conditions, the Wellness & Recreation Center must respond to conditions in Monroe.

Special Needs Shelters
If you have special needs and are evacuating to a shelter, please come to a special needs shelter rather than a general public shelter.
Locations and directions are available in the new EM app.
Please get your items together and make sure if you need a caregiver, they accompany and plan to stay with you at the shelter.
Make sure you have your oxygen and medication refilled today, and bring any special dietary items and other medical items you may need.
Please understand that the hospitals are not shelters. 
Special needs shelter evacuees should contact Volusia County Animal Services at 386-248-1790 to discuss assistance for sheltering pets.

Monroe County is opening four refuges of last resort due to the challenges of evacuating all Keys residents and the life-threatening winds and dangerous storm surge expected from Hurricane Irma.

The following refuges of last resort will open at 7 a.m. on Saturday. No services will be available at those sites. And, they only will be open until tropical storm force winds subside.

These refuges of last resort are only to provide a safe location to ride out the storm rather than to be stuck in a vehicle or structure that is unsafe.  They will close again after the unsafe weather conditions have passed.  They are not recovery shelters.

general population shelters are a last resort, and should only be used by those living in homes that are potentially unsafe in high winds (e.g. mobile homes), people who live in flood-prone areas, and people who have nowhere else to go.
Bring any needed bedding. When packing to go to a shelter, please bring special dietary foods, baby food, diapers (and other child necessities), prescription medications, a small cooler of ice if refrigeration is needed as the shelter cannot be responsible for your medications. Also bring spare clothing, personal care items (hygiene, toiletries, etc.), spare eyeglasses/contacts, and identification.

Make sure you have your oxygen and medication refilled today, and bring any special dietary items and other medical items you may need.

general population shelters are a last resort, and should only be used by those living in homes that are potentially unsafe in high winds (e.g. mobile homes), people who live in flood-prone areas, and people who have nowhere else to go.
Bring any needed bedding. When packing to go to a shelter, please bring special dietary foods, baby food, diapers (and other child necessities), prescription medications, a small cooler of ice if refrigeration is needed as the shelter cannot be responsible for your medications. Also bring spare clothing, personal care items (hygiene, toiletries, etc.), spare eyeglasses/contacts, and identification.

general population shelters are a last resort, and should only be used by those living in homes that are potentially unsafe in high winds (e.g. mobile homes), people who live in flood-prone areas, and people who have nowhere else to go.
Bring any needed bedding. When packing to go to a shelter, please bring special dietary foods, baby food, diapers (and other child necessities), prescription medications, a small cooler of ice if refrigeration is needed as the shelter cannot be responsible for your medications. Also bring spare clothing, personal care items (hygiene, toiletries, etc.), spare eyeglasses/contacts, and identification.

general population shelters are a last resort, and should only be used by those living in homes that are potentially unsafe in high winds (e.g. mobile homes), people who live in flood-prone areas, and people who have nowhere else to go.
Bring any needed bedding. When packing to go to a shelter, please bring special dietary foods, baby food, diapers (and other child necessities), prescription medications, a small cooler of ice if refrigeration is needed as the shelter cannot be responsible for your medications. Also bring spare clothing, personal care items (hygiene, toiletries, etc.), spare eyeglasses/contacts, and identification.

general population shelters are a last resort, and should only be used by those living in homes that are potentially unsafe in high winds (e.g. mobile homes), people who live in flood-prone areas, and people who have nowhere else to go.
Bring any needed bedding. When packing to go to a shelter, please bring special dietary foods, baby food, diapers (and other child necessities), prescription medications, a small cooler of ice if refrigeration is needed as the shelter cannot be responsible for your medications. Also bring spare clothing, personal care items (hygiene, toiletries, etc.), spare eyeglasses/contacts, and identification.
