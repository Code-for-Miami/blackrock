## User Story: Data Editor

As someone collecting and verifying information about human services, I want to assess data from multiple sources and produce the best possible version of the truth, so that I can produce more accurate data with less time and effort.

I want to be able to see suggested entries, and identified conflicts, in order to focus on what needs my attention.

I want to be able to resolve conflicts and verify that information is correct, in order to publish reliable data.
